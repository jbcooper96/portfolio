I began my full-stack development career in the summer of 2018, building web applications for Kent State University. My role involved developing full-stack applications using .NET Core for the backend and React.js for the frontend. It was during this time that I first developed a deep appreciation for JavaScript and its ecosystem. After a year at Kent State, I transitioned to a position at Acumen Solutions, a Salesforce consulting firm.


At Acumen Solutions, I specialized in developing applications using Lightning Web Components (LWC)—a lightweight JavaScript framework optimized for the Salesforce platform. I worked with a range of enterprise clients, including HID, College Board, Brink’s, and Steelcase, contributing to projects that enhanced their business processes and customer experiences. As part of an Agile SCRUM team, my responsibilities included gathering client requirements, implementing requested features using test-driven development (TDD), and maintaining and troubleshooting live systems. In 2021, Salesforce acquired Acumen Solutions, and I transitioned to Salesforce Professional Services, where I continued developing custom enterprise solutions for nearly five years.


One of my most significant projects at Salesforce was for Steelcase, a global furniture company. Steelcase employs interior designers to help clients create tailored office spaces featuring Steelcase products. As the lead developer, I was responsible for building a “Pinterest-like” application that enabled designers to curate and share visual inspiration with clients. The application was developed using Lightning Web Components and leveraged Steelcase’s Salesforce org as both the backend and database. Within my SCRUM team, I took ownership of a significant portion of development tasks, including overseeing a large-scale data migration of product data. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was successfully launched after six months of development, and I continued enhancing the application with new features over the next two years.


In 2024, I dedicated time to expanding my knowledge in artificial intelligence and revisiting modern React.js development while exploring new career opportunities. I implemented small-scale versions of transformers and diffusion models to gain a deeper understanding of large language models (LLMs) and image generation techniques. Additionally, I developed from-scratch implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms, including Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), applying them to train AI agents to play Pong.


Currently, I am working on a note-taking application called Whiteboard, built with Electron.js to support cross-platform compatibility and React.js for rendering the user interface. Whiteboard features a rich-text WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor and basic drawing functionality, implemented using the HTML5 Canvas API. My goal is to create an intuitive, flexible note-taking experience that bridges structured text and freeform sketching.


As I look toward my next opportunity, I am eager to join a challenging and intellectually stimulating environment where I can leverage my strong problem-solving skills, deep technical expertise, and passion for building impactful software solutions.
