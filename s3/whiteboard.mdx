# Whiteboard - A Cross-Platform Note-Taking App 

Whiteboard is a lightweight, cross-platform note-taking application built with Electron.js. 
It helps you stay organized with resizable sticky notes and an intuitive line-drawing tool to visualize your thoughts. 
Whether youâ€™re brainstorming, sketching ideas, or jotting down quick notes, Whiteboard provides a seamless and flexible 
experience.

# Implementation Details

The user interface is built using React for state and DOM management, the rich text WYSIWYG(what you see is what you get) editor
features are built on top of a library called Slate, and the line-drawing/editing features are built directly on top of Html5 canvas.
I will detail the overall architecture as well as some interesting implementation intricacies below:

## Board Component

The main component of interest is the Board component. There are two major state variables "Lines" and "Stickers", a list of Line
objects and Sticker objects respectively, each managed by their own reducers.

As shown above, both the line and sticker objects feature X and Y coordinates denoting their location on the board with the 
(0, 0) point being the top left corner; the line object's coordinates are broken up into start and end locations. There is also
a type attribute as stickers can styled as regular stickers(shown above), tables, or text boxes and lines can be either directional 
or non-directional.

A large portion of the board logic is devoted to event handling, specifically the mouse move and mouse up events as they are needed
to drag or resize stickers and to draw or edit lines. To keep things clean in the Board component the logic for handling these
events lives in seperate event handlers for each way of interacting with the board (drawing, draggings stickers, etc..), all sharing 
a common interface.

The EventHandlersManager class lives in the Board component and the Board component calls the startDrawing, startDragging, editLine,
resizeSticker, or createAndResizeSticker methods when the user begins the respective action. The EventHandlersManager then
creates the correct EventHandler for the action and assigns it to its eventManager attribute. Now the Board component can just call the
mouseUp and mouseMove methods on the EventHandlersManager in its respective event handler functions and the EventHandlersManager delegates to 
the correct EventHandler. The event handlers can then update the edited sticker or line position directly because they have a 
reference to the Stickers and Lines state variables, passed to them in the BoardEvent object.

## Canvas Component

```js
export default function Canvas({ lines, ref, eventManager }) {
    const canvas = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        redraw();
    }, [lines]);

    useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
        return {
            getBoundingClientRect: () => {
                return canvas.current.getBoundingClientRect();
            },
            drawCircle: (x, y, radius) => {
                drawCircle(x, y, radius);
            },
            drawLine: (line) => {
                drawLine(line);
            },
            redraw: () => {
                redraw();
            }
        }
    }, [canvas, lines]);

    const drawCircle = (x, y, radius) => {
        const ctx = canvas.current.getContext("2d");
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(x, y, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
        ctx.stroke();
    }

    const drawLine = (line) => {
        const [arrowPoint1, arrowPoint2] = CanvisLogicHandler.getArrowPointsForLine(line);
        const ctx = canvas.current.getContext("2d");
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.moveTo(line.start.x, line.start.y);
        ctx.lineTo(line.end.x, line.end.y);
        if (line.type === LineTypes.ARROW) {
            ctx.lineTo(arrowPoint1.x, arrowPoint1.y);
            ctx.lineTo(line.end.x, line.end.y);
            ctx.lineTo(arrowPoint2.x, arrowPoint2.y);
        }
        ctx.lineWidth = 1;
        ctx.strokeStyle = line.hover ? LINE_COLOR_HOVER : LINE_COLOR;
        ctx.stroke();
    }

    const redraw = () => {
        if (canvas.current) {
            const ctx = canvas.current.getContext("2d");
            ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.current.width, canvas.current.height);
            for (let line of lines) {
                drawLine(line);
                if (eventManager.eventHandler.lineBeingEditiedId !== undefined && line.id === eventManager.eventHandler.lineBeingEditiedId) {
                    let point = eventManager.eventHandler.linePointBeingEdited === LinePoint.START ? line.start : line.end;
                    drawCircle(point?.x, point?.y, LINE_POINT_EDIT_CIRCLE_RADIUS);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return (<canvas height="1000" width="2000" ref={canvas} />);
}
```

The HTML5 canvas is wrapped in a component, fittingly called Canvas, with the Lines state variable from the Board component passed
as a prop. It has a function drawLine to draw a line, a function drawCircle to draw a circle (used for some hover mechanics with the lines that I'll touch on later),
and a function redraw to clear the canvas and redraw all the lines. I use useEffect with the lines prop as a dependency to call
redraw every time there is a change to lines list.
